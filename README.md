## Abstract
The liberal and poorly documented deployment of anti-personnel landmines has led to a global humanitarian crisis. Current methods of landmine removal, including military-grade equipment, trained animals, and manual deminers, are dangerous, ineffective, and expensive. The goal of our project is to create a cost-effective system that can increase the safety and efficiency of global humanitarian demining efforts.

Our solution has three main parts. A rover will search a user defined area for unexploded landmines. When the rover finds a landmine, it will record the location. After the search is complete, a drone will then fly to the locations of the landmines and will drop a small payload onto the mines to detonate them. A base station acts as the communication link between the rover and the drone and provides a user interface for the operator to control the system.

# Usage


## Note:
The code in the "HW_Interface" folder is designed to run on a Teensy 3.5. To compile, it requires the PWMServo library, a copy of which is included in the "libraries" folder. Additionally, the Teensyduino add-on for the Arduino IDE is needed.

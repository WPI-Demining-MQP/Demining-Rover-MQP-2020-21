### Abstract
The use of PNM-1 anti-personnel landmines, along with poor documentation and scale of their deployment, has led to a humanitarian crisis. Current methods of landmine removal, including military-grade equipment, trained animals, and manual deminers, are dangerous, ineffective, and expensive. Our project will develop a cost-effective autonomous robotic solution to the world's landmine crisis by utilizing a rover and drone working in tandem. An easy-to-use application will combine these systems and make the solution accessible to non-technical users.


# Usage


## Note:
The code in the "HW_Interface" folder is designed to run on a Teensy 3.5. To compile, it requires the PWMServo library, a copy of which is included in the "libraries" folder. Additionally, the Teensyduino add-on for the Arduino IDE is needed.

## Other Repositories Needed:
Base Station Code: https://github.com/edfoltan/MQP_DAS/   
Drone Code: https://github.com/avanosten/Demining-Drone-MQP-2019-20/
